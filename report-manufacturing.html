                The term “cyber security” in manufacturing refers to the security of data and information related to the
                manufacturing process.
                This can include everything from the design and engineering of products to the manufacturing process
                itself and even the finished
                products. In today’s interconnected world, where businesses and individuals rely heavily on technology,
                it’s more important than
                ever to ensure that data and information related to manufacturing is secure.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are a number of cyber security threats that manufacturing companies need to be aware of. One of
                the most common is cyber
                espionage, which is when someone tries to gain unauthorized access to a company’s data in order to steal
                trade secrets or other
                sensitive information. This can be done through a variety of means, such as hacking into a company’s
                computer systems or using
                social engineering to trick employees into giving up login credentials.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another common threat is ransomware, which is when a malicious actor encrypts a company’s data and then
                demands a ransom be paid
                in order to decrypt it. This can be extremely costly for a company, not to mention disruptive to the
                manufacturing process.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, another threat that is particularly relevant to manufacturing is industrial espionage, which is
                when someone tries
                to steal information or trade secrets in order to gain a competitive advantage. This can be done through
                a variety of means, such
                as hacking into a company’s systems, social engineering, or even physical theft.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are a number of steps that manufacturing companies can take to protect themselves from cyber
                security threats. These
                include implementing strong security measures, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, as
                well as training employees
                on how to spot and avoid phishing attacks. Additionally, companies should have a incident response plan
                in place in case of a breach.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ultimately, cyber security in manufacturing is a critical issue that companies need to be aware of. By
                taking steps to protect
                themselves, they can help ensure that their data and information is safe from malicious actors.
